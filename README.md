# MLBpayrollVSrecordBOT
Twitter bot that posts the two teams most overperforming and underperforming expectations of payroll.

Includes code to post figure (as .png) showing linear relationship (or lack thereof) between win percentage (record) and payroll for the entire league.  However, rtweet does not yet have the functionality to post images under the Twitter API v2.  Code will be updated as soon as functionality is added.
